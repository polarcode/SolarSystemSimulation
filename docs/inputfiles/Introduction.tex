\chapter{Introduction}
This project aims at creating a simple modle of our solar system using {\em MatLab.} While putting emphasis on the visuals, we kept the mathematical aspect simple.

Trajectories are not calculated and the orbits are perfect circles, due to the simple fact that the difference would be hardly noticeable. The sizes and distances are mostly to scale. We use a logarithmic scale for the sizes and a linear, though a very small scale, for the distances.
